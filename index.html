<p>PCI Express (PCIe) is a high-speed bus standard, which has superiority over the conventional standards in terms of the throughput, scalability, and many other functionalities.
  Such an improvement of PCIe makes it a promising alternative of the host interfaces or the inter-connections for emerging high-performance storage systems. To help system (storage) designers explore their PCIe-based systems, 
  PCIeNetSim provides a limited simulation framework for PCIe-based networks according to the PCIe specification. Using PCIeNetSim, users can attach their own service-user model (e.g., host system which genernates I/O requests) and service-provider model 
  (e.g., storage system which processes the given I/O requests) at the both ends. The current version of PCIeNetSim provides a simple queue model (which accumulates I/O traces) and a naive NAND flash model (which responds each I/O request) 
  on both sides of the PCIe network, as an example.

<p> Right figure (cited from PCI Express Base Specification Revision 3.0) presents a topology example based on PCIe components. 
PCIeNetSim provides customized PCIe-based networks by modeling the PCIe components and their connections, as described in the red box.
Using PCIeNetSim, users can configure their own PCIe-based system by attaching the necessary component models at both ends of the network. 
To support such scalable and configurable PCIe networks, PCIeNetSim has below characteristics.
  
</p>
<ul>
 <li> <h5> Separate PCIe Components </h5>
  <p> PCIe network consists of four major PCIe components: root complex (RC), switch (SW), endpoint (EP), and link.
  RC generates PCIe packets at the host side, whereas EP processes the packets at the storage side. A set of SWs connects RCs and EPs, 
  while links are laid between any neighboring PCIe components.  
  PCIeNetsim enables users to construct any type of networks by separately modeling each PCIe component. 
  The number of ports and lanes can be user-specified, which realizes a customized PCIe network to comply with the PCIe specification.
  </p>  
 </li>  
 <li> <h5> Scalable Link Spec </h5> 
  <p> Between any two PCIe components, there should be a PCIe link to connect them. Its data transfer capability is determined by the PCIe version, 
  the number of lanes it employs. Depending on the specification version, the data rate of single-lane link improves by almost double. 
  Also, the data rate can scalably increase as the number of lanes the link includes increases (from one to thirty-two lanes). 
  In addition to such performance scalability, PCIeNetSim provides actual data rates (which are a bit smaller than the specified ones) 
  by considering the encoding overheads. It is noted that the specification defines 8/10b or 128/130b encoding in the physical layer.
